# ER Diagram Sketch

- The initial sketch of the entities and their relationships provides a clear visual representation of the data model
  for a fragrance database.
  ![ER Sketch](src/main/resources/diagram_sketch.png)

# ER Diagram Implementation

- The optimized entity-relationship (ER) diagram showcases a well-structured database where normalization and the use of
  junction tables ensure data integrity, minimize redundancy, and improve scalability.

### Fragrance Table

- The fragrance table is optimized to ensure all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key (
  fragrance_id). This eliminates transitive dependencies and ensures the table adheres to Third Normal Form (3NF).

```
Attributes:
        fragrance_id (Primary Key): Uniquely identifies a fragrance.
        name (Text): Stores the name of the fragrance.
        year (Integer): Represents the year of creation.
        brand_id (Foreign Key): Links to the brand table.
```

### Brand Table

- By moving brand into its own table, we reduce data redundancy and enable efficient management of brand-related
  attributes.

- The brand table allows centralized management of brand information, reducing redundancy when multiple fragrances share
  the same brand.

```
Attributes:
        brand_id (Primary Key): Uniquely identifies a brand.
        name (Text): Stores the name of the brand.
        country_id (Foreign Key): Links to the country table.
        Additional fields, such as the founding year or logo URL, can be added here for further scalability.
```

- This approach simplifies updates (e.g., modifying a brandâ€™s name or country) and ensures consistency across fragrances
  associated with the same brand.

### Country Table

- The country table is designed to store country names shared by multiple entities, such as fragrance, brand, and
  perfumer. This ensures consistent naming and avoids redundancy.

```
Attributes:
        country_id (Primary Key): Uniquely identifies a country.
        name (Text): Stores the name of the country.
        image_url (Optional): Can store a flag or visual representation.
```

- By using a shared country table, both fragrances and perfumers can reference the same country entity, ensuring data
  consistency and minimizing redundant country data across tables.

### Concentration Table

- Fragrances can exist in multiple concentrations (e.g., EDC, EDT, EDP, Parfum). Creating a concentration table improves
  scalability by storing these variations centrally.

```
Attributes:
        concentration_id (Primary Key): Uniquely identifies a concentration.
        name (Text): Describes the concentration type (e.g., "EDP").
        description (Text): Provides additional details about the concentration.
```

### Fragrance-Concentration Junction Table

- The fragrance_concentration table facilitates a many-to-many relationship between fragrance and concentration. Each
  fragrance can exist in multiple concentrations, and each concentration can apply to multiple fragrances.

```
Attributes:
        fragrance_id (Primary Key): References the fragrance entity.
        concentration_id (Primary Key): References the concentration entity.
```

- This junction table ensures that any new concentration type can be added without impacting the core fragrance or
  concentration tables.

### Notes and Accords

```
    The note and accord tables manage the hierarchical structure of fragrance compositions:
        accord: Represents broad scent categories (e.g., Citrus, Woody).
        note: Represents specific scent ingredients (e.g., Bergamot, Cedarwood) and is linked to accord.
```

- By organizing note and accord data into separate tables, the database design supports detailed queries (e.g., "Find
  all
  fragrances with Citrus accords") while avoiding duplication.

### Junction Tables for Many-to-Many Relationships

- The optimized design includes several junction tables to handle many-to-many relationships effectively:

```
fragrance_perfumer:
        Connects fragrances to their creators (perfumers).
        Allows multiple perfumers to be associated with a single fragrance.
        
perfumer_brand:
        Links perfumers to the brands they collaborate with.
        Enables tracking of perfumer-brand relationships over time.
```

- `500 Internal Server Error`: Unexpected server error.

---

# **Containerize**

- To manage containerized services efficiently, `docker-compose` is used to orchestrate multiple containers from a
  single configuration file. Each service (e.g., Spring Boot application, database) runs in its own container,
  maintaining isolation. These containers communicate with each other through a bridge network set up in
  the `docker-compose.yml` file, ensuring seamless interaction while persisting shared context.

---

# **Hosting**

#### **Render**:

- Render provides an easy and efficient solution for hosting Spring Boot applications directly from a GitHub repository.
  By leveraging the `Dockerfile` in the repository, Render builds and deploys the application, abstracting much of the
  complexity involved in manual setup.

#### **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**:

AWS Elastic Beanstalk (EBS) is used for hosting Spring Boot applications, but careful configuration is needed:

- EBS operates on **port 5000**, while the default Spring Boot application runs on **port 8080**.
- To ensure compatibility, you can either:
    - Modify `application.properties` to set `server.port=5000`.
    - Configure AWS to map EBS's port 5000 to your Spring Boot application's port 8080 during environment creation or
      using EC2 configurations.

---

# **Testing**

- Initially, **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** was adopted to write controllers. This approach involved writing tests
  before the implementation to ensure functionality met requirements. However, as development progressed, TDD was not
  consistently followed across the entire project. Adhering to TDD throughout the project would have made the
  application more resilient to changes and regressions.

---

# **JPA (Java Persistence API)**

#### **Entity Relationships**:

1. **One-to-Many and Many-to-One**:

- Example: A `Perfumer` entity has a `Country`.
- The "many" side (e.g., `Perfumer`) manages the relationship and is mapped by the "one" side (`Country`).

2. **Avoiding Infinite Recursion**:

- For bidirectional relationships, avoid recursion by:
    - Excluding `toString`, `equals`, and `hashCode` methods from referencing the inverse side.
    - Using annotations like `@JsonIgnore` or `@JsonBackReference` to prevent serialization loops.

3. **Many-to-Many**:

- Example: `Fragrance` and `Perfumer` have a many-to-many relationship.
- A join table is automatically created by JPA, but the owning and inverse sides must be clearly defined.
- Use `@JsonIgnore` on the owner side (`Fragrance`) and `@JsonBackReference` on the inverse side (`Perfumer`) to handle
  serialization properly.

#### **Design Considerations**:

- For complex bidirectional relationships, plan the application design and architecture carefully from the outset.
  Mismanagement of these relationships can lead to serialization errors, difficulty in testing, and architectural
  inefficiencies.

---

### **Lombok**

- Lombok simplifies the codebase significantly by generating boilerplate code such as getters, setters, constructors,
  and more through annotations. However, it is crucial to use Lombok annotations judiciously to avoid unintended
  behaviors and maintain readability.

---

### **Controllers**

- Each entity has its own controller to handle incoming requests and delegate them to the corresponding CRUD methods in
  the service layer. More complex controllers, such as those for `Fragrance` and `Perfumer`, manage additional
  functionalities due to the intricate relationships between entities. For example:

- A `Fragrance` controller logically manages collections of `Notes`, ensuring cohesion and proper encapsulation of
  responsibilities.

---

### **Services**

- Separate service classes are implemented for each controller to maintain the **separation of concerns**. This approach
  prevents controllers from handling business logic directly. For more complex entities like `Fragrance`:

- Dedicated services are created to manage indirect dependencies on related entities.
- This avoids reusing existing entity services, which could lead to **circular dependencies** and architectural issues.

---

### **Summary**

- The design philosophy focuses on modularity, maintainability, and scalability:

- Containers are efficiently managed using `docker-compose`.
- Hosting solutions like Render and AWS EBS are configured to align with deployment needs.
- TDD and JPA relationship best practices ensure a robust and well-tested application.
- Lombok and dedicated service classes streamline code and maintain clear boundaries between responsibilities.
